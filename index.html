      The Hawaii Framework is a Java framework for developing Spring based applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combining Spring Boot and the Hawaii production-ready features and auto configuration
      brings even more power and simplicity to developers, without sacrificing flexibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hawaii Framework is developed internally at <a href="https://www.ilionx.com/">ilionx</a> (formerly <a href="https://qnh.eu/">QNH</a>) and is used in projects
      for medium and large enterprise customers.
      Hawaii is open source software released under the Apache 2.0 license.
